## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67000000
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact
  beta:  0.033

  ## c is the contact rate per day. 13 is an accepted
  ## value on average under normal circumstances
  c:     13.0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation this is one week according to UK policy
  kappa: 0.1429

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are tracee
  ## tracing is triggered by testing
  chi:   0.5

  ## eta is the success rate of testing
  eta:   0.25

## Exogenous interventions
interventions:
  ## after three months, lockdown, reduce contact by 70%
  - time: 90
    parameters:
      c: 3.9
  ## after six months, relax to 50% and introduce testing and tracing
  - time: 150
    parameters:
      c: 6.5
      theta: 0.1429
  ## after nine months, relax more, some distancing
  - time: 210
    parameters:
      c: 10
