## This is Scenario 1: No Tracing, Testing or Isolation. Phased lifting of lockdown
## 
## Lockdown lifted in a phased way as per UK government plan, to be announed very 
## soon we hope! e.g. Schools & some workplaces open 1st June, more open 29th June,
## everything open 27th July 
##

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta:  0.033

  ## c is the contact rate per day. 13 is an accepted
  ## value on average under normal circumstances.
  c:     13.0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.
interventions:
  ## After three months, start of restrictions on 16th March. 
  ## Reduce contacts from 10 to 13 per day (by ~25%).
  - time: 89    # 16th March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: 10
  ## After one more week, Lockdown, on 23rd March. 
  ## Reduce contacts to 4 per day (~70% reduction).
  - time: 96    # 23rd March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: 4
  
  ## On 1st June, start relax lockdown, phase one
  ## Contacts per day increse from 4 to 7
  - time: 166
    parameters:
      c: 7

  ## On 29th June, relax lockdown more, phase two
  ## Contacts per day increse from 7 to 9
  - time: 194
    parameters:
      c: 9
      
  ## On 27th July, relax lockdown more, phase three
  ## Contacts per day increse from 9 to 11
  - time: 222
    parameters:
      c: 11   # assume contacts per day won't go back up to pre-pandemic level of 13
